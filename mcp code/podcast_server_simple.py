Podcast Generator MCP Server Help

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
1. generate_script - Generate podcast dialogue
2. create_audio - Convert script to audio (requires TTS setup)

USAGE:
- Use generate_script to create dialogue for any topic
- Specify number of speakers (1-4) and duration (1-30 minutes)
- Use create_audio to convert the script to speech

EXAMPLES:
- Generate a 5-minute podcast about AI: 
  generate_script(topic="Artificial Intelligence", duration_minutes=5)
- Create 3-speaker discussion about climate change:
  generate_script(topic="Climate Change", num_speakers=3, duration_minutes=10)

AUDIO GENERATION:
- Requires OpenAI API key for basic TTS
- Optional: ElevenLabs API key for premium voices
- Set OPENAI_API_KEY or ELEVENLABS_API_KEY environment variables

NOTES:
- Scripts are generated using simple dialogue patterns
- Audio files are saved as MP3 format
- For best results, edit generated scripts before audio conversion
